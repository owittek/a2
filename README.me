# A2

This bot is supposed to verify contributors and give them a role. Unfortunately this would require some kind of webserver that handles an oauth2 authentification just to receive publicly displayed discord connections. So this project will be on standstill until I either find the motivation work with Discord API requirements or until they find a better solution.
